These libraries are primarly meant for MOD authors and most of them requires
phpBB to work. You should be able to read the code to see if phpBB is required
or not.

They are all licensed under Gnu GPL version 2.

We will try to add exampe files and some documentation to all libraries, but
that is a work in progress and is not highly prioritized. If you want to help
documenting them, please do.

Limited support for the libraries are given at http://phpbbmodders.net/


Have fun
